## Introduction

This article is a summary of most recurrent formulas that I use when dealing with 3D geometry.
Most of them are basic 3D computing, learned through courses or free material found online ([guess where](https://stackoverflow.com/)): the goal here is not to present something extremely complex, but rather to gather all those simple and often used formulas, so that I don't need to search for them everytime in many different places! You can thank me later :wink:
As a plus, I will leave a sample python implementation, so that you can copy-paste or just having a starting point for your own implementation in a spicy language.
Let's get started!

## Vector - Vector projection

Projecting vector U on vector V is defined as:
\\[  proj_{\overrightarrow{v}} (\overrightarrow{u}) = \frac{\overrightarrow{u} 
    \cdot \overrightarrow{v}}{||v||^2} \cdot \overrightarrow{v} \\]

Implementation with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

```
import numpy as np

def projection_vec2vec(u, v):
   # Projection of vector u on vector v
   return (np.dot(u, v) / (np.linalg.norm(v) ** 2)) * v
```

## Vector - Plane projection

Projecting vector U on a plane defined by its normal N is defined as:
\\[      proj_{plane} (\overrightarrow{u}) = \overrightarrow{u} - proj_{\overrightarrow{n}}(\overrightarrow{u}) = \overrightarrow{u} - \frac{\overrightarrow{u} 
    \cdot \overrightarrow{n}}{||n||^2} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \\]

Note that Vector - Vector projection is involved, so we can re-use code above.

Implementation requires [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and `projection_vec2vec`, that is described above:

```
def projection_vec2plane(u, n):
   # Projection of vector u on plane orthogonal to vector n
   return u - projection_vec2vec(u, n)
```

## Cosine distance between two vectors

The cosine distance between vector U and vector V is defined as
\\[    cos_{dist}(\overrightarrow{u}, \overrightarrow{v}) = 1 - cos_{sim}(\overrightarrow{u}, \overrightarrow{v}) = 1 -  \frac{\overrightarrow{u} 
    \cdot \overrightarrow{v}}{||u|| * ||v||} \\]

Implementation with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

```
import numpy as np

def cosine_distance(u, v):
   # Cosine distance between vector u and vector v
   cosine_similarity = np.dot(u, v) / (np.linalg.norm(u) * np.linalg.norm(v))
   return 1 - cosine_similarity
```


## Line - Plane intersection

Assuming the line is represented by a point on the line L0 and the direction of the line L and the plane is represented by a point on the plane P0 and its normal P, the intersection between line L and plane P is defined as:

* if \\(\overrightarrow{l} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \neq 0\\) a point p defined as \\(p = l_0 + l * d\\), where \\(d = \frac{(p_0 - l_0) \cdot \overrightarrow{n}}{\overrightarrow{l} \cdot \overrightarrow{n}}\\)
* if \\(\overrightarrow{l} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \neq 0\\), then:
    * if \\((p_0 - l_0) \cdot n = 0\\), the line is contained in the plane, _i.e._ the line intersects the plane at each point of the line
    * otherwise, line and plane are parallel and there is no intersection between the two.

Implementation with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

```
import numpy as np

def intersection_vec2plane(vec_point, vec_direction,
                            plane_point, plane_normal):
   # Intersection between vector and plane
   d = np.dot(plane_normal, plane_point - vec_point) /
        np.dot(vec_direction, plane_normal)
   return vec_point + vec_direction * d
```

## Offset of a point in a line

Assuming the line is represented by a point on the line L0 and the direction of the line L and given a point P, the offset of point P in line L is defined as:

\\[  \texttt{line_offset} (p) =   \overrightarrow{p - l0}  \cdot \overrightarrow{l} \\]

This can also be described as the _distance between point P and L0 on the line L._ 

Implementation with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

```
import numpy as np

def offset_in_line(line_point, line_direction, point):
   # Offset of point on a line
   return np.dot(p - line_point, line_direction)
```

## Bonus: Euclidean distance between two points

This is a bonus paragraph as euclidean distance is pretty straightforward, but I wanted to point out a fast and concise implementation of it (requiring [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) though).
The euclidean distance between two points P and Q  is defined as:

\\[    d(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{(p_i - q_i)^2} \\]

The [L2-norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Norm.html) is defined as:

\\[     \|\|x\|\|_{2} := \sqrt{x_1^2 + \dots + x_n^2} \\]

Then it's easy to reformulate as:

```
import numpy as np

def euclidean_dist(p, q):
   # Euclidean distance between point p and point q
   return np.linalg.norm(p - q)
```

This list will be updated whenever I find myself searching for some formulas repeatedly.
If you found any error or want to add some formulas, maybe if you use this as a vademecum (as I personally do), just let me know with a comment below!
